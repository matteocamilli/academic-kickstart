## Recent activities

My main research interests cover the macro-areas of **formal methods** and **software engineering** with particular focus on:

- Software requirements specification, analysis and verification;
- Model-based testing;
- Uncertainty quantification along the software lifecycle;
- Design-time and runtime verification;
- Formal modeling using Markov models;

and the application of methodologies, theories, approaches and techniques specific
to the above research areas to complex, advanced, distributed, time-dependent,
service-oriented, component-based and self-adaptive systems.

A list of my research papers can be obtained from different sources reported below.
